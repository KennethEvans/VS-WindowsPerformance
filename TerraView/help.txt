"			 TerraView\n" +
"			 =========\n" +
"\n" +
"TerraView is an application to obtain images and display them.  The\n" +
"images are United States Geographical Society (USGS) images that are\n" +
"provided by the Microsoft TerraServer USA or by Microsoft MapPoint.\n" +
"The Microsoft TerraServer is a free Web Service.  It requires an\n" +
"Internet connection.  To get the MapPoint images you need to have\n" +
"Microsoft MapPoint installed on your computer.\n" +
"\n" +
"When you start the program, the Control Panel will display.  You can\n" +
"use it to choose the location by latitude and longitude and also vary\n" +
"the parameters.  When you press the Go button on the Control Panel, it\n" +
"will display the image.  If you want to search for a location by name\n" +
"rather than by specifying the latitude and longitude, first select the\n" +
"desired parameters on the Control Panel and select Apply.  Then select\n" +
"Search on the Options Menu and find a location by typing its name.\n" +
"When you select OK on the Search dialog, it will display the location\n" +
"using the parameters you applied.  If you did not apply any, it will\n" +
"use the default parameters.\n" +
"\n" +
"The image is displayed in the TerraView Main Window.  Clicking in the\n" +
"Main Window re-centers the image.  The Control Panel has additional\n" +
"controls for selecting the image and is described in more detail\n" +
"below.  You can also use Search at any time as described above.\n" +
"\n" +
"You can also zoom as you click in the Main Window, using the following\n" +
"modifier keys:\n" +
"\n" +
"	 Alt + Left\t\t\tZoom In\n" +
"	 Ctrl + Alt + Left\t\tZoom Out\n" +
"	 Shift + Alt + Left\t\tZoom In 2x\n" +
"	 Shift + Ctrl + Alt + Left\t\tZoom Out 2x\n" +

"Save GPSL\n" +
"\n" +
"Once an image and the corresponding GPSL file have been saved via Save\n" +
"GPSL, the two files will be saved again, overwriting the originals.\n" +
"This allows you to quickly resave the current image, which is easily\n" +
"opened in GPSLink to replace the current image in the Map Window.\n" +
"\n" +
"Save As...\n" +
"\n" +
"This item allows you to save the current image as a JPEG, PNG, BMP,\n" +
"GIF or TIFF image, prompting for a filename.\n" +
"\n" +
"Save As GPSL...\n" +
"\n" +
"This item first allows you to save an image file, the same as for Save\n" +
"As, and then allows you to save an additional file in GPSL format that\n" +
"references the image file.  The second file has a .gpsl extension.\n" +
"The two files can then be used in GPSLink.  Opening the GPSL file in\n" +
"GPSLink will load the image into the Map Window in GPSLink and the\n" +
"image will already be properly calibrated.\n" +

"\n" +
"MapType\n" +
"\n" +
"TerraView gets three types of images: Photo, Topo, and UrbanAreas.\n" +
"Photo and UrbanAreas are aerial views.  UrbanAreas only exist for\n" +
"certain parts of the United States but are available in higher\n" +
"resolution and in color.  The UrbanAreas images are typically newer\n" +
"than the Photo maps, as well.  Topo images are USGS topological maps.\n" +
"These are older yet.  If MapPoint 2002 is installed on your system,\n" +
"TerraView will also get images from MapPoint.  These images show roads\n" +
"and other landmarks and are a useful addition to the types of data\n" +
"obtained from the other images.\n" +
"\n" +
"Scale\n" +
"\n" +
"Allows you to choose the scale for the images.  Scale32m, for example,\n" +
"means 32 meters per pixel.\n" +
"\n" +
"Longitude\n" +
"Latitude\n" +
"\n" +
"Allows you to specify a decimal longitude and latitude.  Longitudes in\n" +
"the United States are negative.\n" +
"\n" +
"Image Width\n" +
"Image Height\n" +
"\n" +
"Allows you to specify the desired image width and height in pixels.\n" +
"\n" +
"Pan\n" +
"\n" +
"Specifies how far to pan in fractions of the image dimensions.  A\n" +
"larger number pans further.\n" +
"\n" +
"Compass Control\n" +
"\n" +
"Allows you to pan and zoom the image.  Panning will be by the fraction\n" +
"specified in Pan.  Scale will be by one increment in the Scale\n" +
"drop-down menu.\n" +

"Go Button\n" +
"\n" +
"The Go button causes a new image to be obtained.\n" +
"\n" +
"Apply Button\n" +
"\n" +
"The apply button applies the current values but does not get a new\n" +
"image.  If you click on the map, it will be re-centered and the type\n" +
"and scale will be as specified in the Control Panel.  This allows you\n" +
"to both center and change the type and scale of the image while only\n" +
"waiting for one download.\n" +

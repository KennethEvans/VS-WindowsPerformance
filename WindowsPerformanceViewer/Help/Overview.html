<p align="left">Windows Performance Viewer accesses the Windows event logs and presents details of the performance in convenient ways. The logs used in this application are those provided by Microsoft-Windows-Diagnostics-Performance. You will probably have to run it as administrator to get access to the diagnostic logs.</p>
<h3><strong>Boot Performance</strong></h3>
<p align="left">These data are found in the Applications and Services Logs | Microsoft | Windows | Diagnostics-Performance | Operational for Event ID = 100.</p>
<p align="left">The&nbsp;<em>BootTime</em>&nbsp;is the sum of the&nbsp;<em>MainPathBootTime,</em>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<em>BootPostBootTime</em>&nbsp;and is the best figure of merit for the time it takes to boot. The&nbsp;<em>MainPathBootTime</em>&nbsp;is roughly the time it takes for the desktop to become functional. There is not enough space in this overview to describe all the available parameters. There is more information on the web.</p>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>If you are installing from a download, just unzip the files into a directory somewhere convenient. Then run it from there. If you are installing from a build, copy these files and directories from the bin/Release directory to a convenient directory..</p>
<ul>
  <li>WindowsPerformanceViewer.exe</li>
  <li>Help</li>
</ul>
<p>To uninstall, just delete these files. </p>
<h3 align="left"><strong>File Menu</strong></h3>
<p align="left"><strong>Create Boot CSV File</strong></p>
<p align="left">Allows you to make a CSV file of all the data and to open it in a spreadsheet. The latter should work if you have a file association for .csv.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Boot Plots...</strong></p>
<p align="left">Allows you to plot any of the parameters found as a function of the&nbsp;<em>BootStartTime</em>, or in fact, any of the other parameters. The default plot is&nbsp;<em>BootTime</em>,&nbsp;<em>MainPathBootTime</em>, and&nbsp;<em>BootPostBootTime</em>as a function of&nbsp;<em>BootStartTime</em>. The plot view has a list box to the left with all the parameters at the top and buttons at the bottom. You can multi-select items to plot on the y axis and single-select an item to appear on the x axis. Not all parameters on the x axis give sensible results. You can however use parameters such as&nbsp;<em>Index</em>,&nbsp;<em>BootStartTime</em>,&nbsp;<em>BootEndTime</em>, and&nbsp;<em>UserBootInstance</em>meaningfully. You can also reset the plot to the default and print it.</p>

# VS-WindowsPerformance

Windows Performance Viewer is a C# application that accesses the Windows event logs and presents details of the performance in convenient ways. The logs used in this application are those provided by Microsoft-Windows-Diagnostics-Performance. You will probably have to run it as administrator to get access to the diagnostic logs. The program does not change anything, just reads the logs.
